'''
Write a program that walks through a folder tree and searches for exceptionally large files or foldersâ€”say, ones that have a file size of more than 100MB AND HAVENT BEEN UPDATED FOR 3 MONTHS
(Remember that, to get a fileâ€™s size, you can use os.path.getsize() from the os module.)
Print these files with their absolute path to the screen.


1. It will be a function - so I can pass a folder path and it runs through it printing all files with set conditions (over 100MB + last change >= 90 days from today)
2. logic for storing matches? list? dictionary? how to relate and delete later? - if dictionary - can store path (and call by name to delete if needed)
key = path; value = list of size and datetime
