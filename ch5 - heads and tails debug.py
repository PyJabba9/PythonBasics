#The following program is meant to be a simple coin toss guessing game. The player gets two guesses. (Itâ€™s an easy game.) However, the program has multiple bugs in it. Run through the program a few times to find the bugs that keep the program from working correctly.
# I would also move comparison in a separate function, which I did in this script

        toss = 'heads'
    else:

    if toss == guess:
